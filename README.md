# scrimbaChoreList
Making a chore list utilizing JS and practicing localStorage as well as other JS concepts. Good project. Challenging.


 <h2>Things to work on Things I learned</h2>
- saving to localStorage need practice on that
- array and indexes
- creating elements within the DOM
- event delegation 
- Getting the concept but just putting everything together and making it all work smoothly is the challenging part but am getting better. Learned a lot such as creating elements within the DOM through JS, guard clauses, saving to localStorage and getting from localStorage, the "DOMContentLoaded" event listener creating the function to loop through the array by forEach method, and getting each individual item to be deleted by its index then on reload it saves to localStorage. Very nice project to test my technical skills and still a lot to learn and this project proved that to me...
